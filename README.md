# README
Python projects in Natural Language Processing (using nltk) from 2019 Clovertex Internship.

final_program.py represents the combination of many things I worked on during the summer,
including collaborative filtering, word clouds, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and more.

Other programs here generally represent one or two components of this larger program.

Note: CSV files needed to run can be found at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/187hhVyS0w8vp61AE9RE4FBv3eBAQt3wa?usp=sharing since they were too large.
